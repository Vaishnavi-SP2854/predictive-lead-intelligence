# 📊 Marketing Funnel Intelligence & Sales Conversion Analytics

A data-driven B2B marketing funnel analytics project designed to analyze lead behavior, evaluate sales development performance, and predict lead-to-customer conversion using machine learning.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world B2B marketing funnel environment where Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) are analyzed to:

- Understand conversion behavior
- Evaluate Sales Development Representative (SDR) performance
- Identify high-value business segments
- Predict conversion probability using Logistic Regression.

The dataset contains lead-level information including business profile, revenue declaration, stock size, and behavioral attributes.

---

## 🎯 Business Objective

The primary objectives of this project:

- Identify factors influencing lead conversion
- Measure conversion rates across business segments
- Evaluate SDR performance efficiency
- Build a predictive model to forecast lead conversion
- Provide data-driven recommendations for sales optimization

# 🏗 4-Day Development Sprint

---

## 🗓 Day 1 — Data Understanding & Cleaning

### ✔ Tasks Completed
- Loaded enterprise B2B funnel dataset
- Inspected missing values and data types
- Converted `won_date` to datetime
- Created target variable `Converted`
- Removed non-informative columns (`has_company`, `has_gtin`)
- Cleaned numeric fields and handled inconsistencies

### 📌 Key Learning
Real-world datasets often contain fully null columns and inconsistent categorical encodings that must be validated before modeling.

---

## 🗓 Day 2 — Funnel & Segment Analysis

### ✔ Tasks Completed
- Calculated overall conversion rate
- Analyzed conversion by:
  - Business Segment
  - Lead Type
  - Behaviour Profile
- Evaluated declared revenue patterns
- Identified high-performing segments

### 📊 Insights
- Certain business segments show significantly higher conversion probability.
- Leads with higher declared monthly revenue tend to convert more often.

---

## 🗓 Day 3 — Sales & Revenue Intelligence

### ✔ Tasks Completed
- Analyzed SDR-level performance
- Measured conversion rate per SDR
- Aggregated revenue contribution by Sales Representative
- Ranked sales performance

### 📈 Business Impact
- Identified top-performing SDRs
- Highlighted segments generating maximum revenue

---

## 🗓 Day 4 — Predictive Modeling

### ✔ Tasks Completed
- Selected relevant features
- Cleaned missing values
- Built Logistic Regression model
- Evaluated classification performance

### 🤖 Model Objective
Predict whether an MQL will convert into a customer based on business and behavioral attributes.
